## What does our company make?
Afi Labs is a software consulting company that has two main lines of business - A) Beautiful and effective software to help logistics companies and their customers manage shipments e.g. Routing Engine (Simply Post, Yeap) / Delivery Engine (Hoch, A21)  and B) Everything else transportation related e.g. AAS (IBM, STE), Busviz (LTA), Ximplify (FX).

## What is our long term vision?
We want to build the infrastructure that makes it easy for any transportation company to run operations. We do this on a consulting (and not product) basis because different customers want different things, so we need to customize our software to best meet their needs.

## How do we achieve this vision?
In the short term, we need to become a *stable* company - this means that we need to earn more money then we spend and reinvest the difference. We also need to make our customers happy so that our track record and reputation grows over time so that it becomes easier to get new customers and build software for them. We've stumbled onto something that transportation and logistics companies urgently need - our job now is to ride this wave and sell our services to as many companies as possible.

In the long term, we need to make sure that the following relationship holds for everything we do: VALUE >> PRICE >> COST i.e. the value that our software provides our customers is much greater than the price we charge them which in turn is much higher than it cost to make our software. Closely related to this is the principle of **margin of safety** and **circle of competence** - we have the discipline to only take on projects that we understand well at prices well above our costs.

Whenever we can, we look for ways to expand our circle of competence particularly if we are paid for the privilege of doing so e.g. we took on the FX project because food inventory management is closely related to food delivery (which might come in a future phase).

## Who are our competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do we fear most?
Our main competitor is the status quo - that our customers keep using some combination of paper, pen and excel to track and manage shipments in their supply chain.

## What do we understand about our business that other companies in it just don't get?
The best way to sell software to logistics companies is through consulting, not software as a service (SaaS) for three big reasons:
- Even though logistics companies roughly do the same thing (send or manage deliveries from point A to B), the way they do so can vary substantially from company to company. This makes it difficult to build a one size fits all SaaS product for logistics.
- Our (largely traditional) customers want to own their software and work with a vendor that they know isn't going out of business
- The long tail (maintenance contracts and extensions to build new features) of software consulting can be extremely profitable
