## Part Time Policy

Part time work refers to other professional, paid jobs outside of your work at Afi Labs. It’s not a black and white topic. There are one-time gigs, other pursuits, or opportunities that help you grow and make life interesting. We want to support that. But we want to make sure professional endeavors outside of Afi Labs don’t create conflicts of interest or affect your time, dedication, or performance at Afi Labs. So it’s a delicate balance.

We also believe that it works better to hold our employees to a high standard and expect you to do the right thing instead of imposing extensive rules. With that in mind, here are some general principles.

### Not OK
- Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to Afi Labs, transportation and logistics software etc).

Afi Labs has a flexible leave policy - this means that you are free to take as much time off as you choose, as long as you get the job done. We want you to focus on producing great results, rather than just putting in hours. We also want you to feel ownership over your work, over your time, and be able to take ownership over the amount of time that you need to reflect and recharge.

Please discuss the days you want to take time off with your supervisor (Afian or Nelson) and make sure that any outstanding work is either completed or handed over to a colleague. Once the leave is approved (in writing, through slack or whatsapp), please update the Movement Chart Trello board (https://trello.com/b/xRuJXqPw/movement-chart).
