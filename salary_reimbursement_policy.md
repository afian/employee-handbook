## Salary Policy
Salaries are paid for month `n` in the first week (hopefully) of month `n+1` in either SGD or USD (depending on your contract). Occasionally, the company (to build business contacts in Vietnam) will pay your salary in VND via a local Vietnam bank. Should this occur, we will use the exchange rate 1 USD = 23000 VND (market exchange rate is about 1 USD = 22500 VND).

## Reimbursement Policy
The company will reimburse employees for expenses incurred in Singapore limited to the following categories:
- Per diem (SGD$28 per work day) which covers incidental food and public transport costs.
- Data plan (approx SGD$15).
- Transportation (taxi, uber, grab etc) to and from the onsite location. Transportation between the airport and hotel is not covered (usually Afian or Nelson will do our best to pick you up ).
- *Budget* airline flight (Jetstart, Vietjet, Tiger Air, Air Asia etc). Employees are expected to arrive the night before (or morning after) their working day e.g. if you start work on Monday, you are expected to be in Singapore on Sunday night or Monday morning. Please discuss the flight details with your supervisor (Afian or Nelson) before you book.

Please list your expenses on the Employee Claims trello (https://trello.com/b/RUbqwRRn/employee-claims) and upload proof of payment e.g. receipts and itemize your expenses in checklist form. Afian will review the claims and will pay it together with salaries at the next paytment cycle. When paid, Afian will check off the expense item. When you have received the payment, please mark the trello card as paid.
