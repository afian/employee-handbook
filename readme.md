## Afi Labs Employee Handbook

This repository is a working document outlining the policies and procedures to be followed by employees at Afi Labs (http://afi.io). When we were small and mostly working part time, there was no need to have a formal set of documents offering guidance on outside employment, salary payment procedures and holiday leave. As we have grown bigger, I have seen the need to put together a formal document outlining not only the "what" but also the "why" of these policies.
