## Leave Policy

Afi Labs has a flexible leave policy - this means that you are free to take as much time off as you choose, as long as you get the job done. We want you to focus on producing great results, rather than just putting in hours. We also want you to feel ownership over your work, over your time, and be able to take ownership over the amount of time that you need to reflect and recharge.

Please discuss the days you want to take time off with your supervisor (Afian or Nelson) and make sure that any outstanding work is either completed or handed over to a colleague. Once the leave is approved (in writing, through slack or whatsapp), please update the Movement Chart Trello board (https://trello.com/b/xRuJXqPw/movement-chart).

## Remote Work Policy

Afi Labs is a Remote First company - we give our employees the freedom to work anywhere. However, from time to time (e.g. for the Alliance 21 contract) I will ask you to come to Singapore to work onsite or attend meetings. This will allow you to better understand the needs of our clients and the challenges that we face as a company in attracting new business and maintaining existing clients. If you will not be working from Saigon (e.g. going back to home town for a few days) please notify your supervisor (Afian) via slack or whatsapp and update the Movement Chart Trello board (https://trello.com/b/xRuJXqPw/movement-chart). This is so that either Afian or Nelson does not visit Saigon while you are away (we come up to interact and work together with everyone on the team).

## Working Hours
All employees are expected to be contactable (via Slack) Monday - Friday, 9 am SGT - 6 pm SGT. We will try to keep to office hours as much as possible but due to the fact that client meetings must be scheduled during office hours, it might only be possible to get you feedback in the evening. If this happens, we do ask that you work at night. If there is no work assigned, just relax (we don't believe in giving employees work to do just to look busy).

### Off in Lieu
If you have to work on weekends or consecutive evenings and would like to be compensated for your time, please speak to your supervisor (Afian) and add an "Off In Lieu" card to the Movement Chart Trello board (https://trello.com/b/xRuJXqPw/movement-chart).
