## Leave Policy

Afi Labs has a flexible leave policy - this means that you are free to take as much time off as you choose, as long as you get the job done. We want you to focus on producing great results, rather than just putting in hours. Please discuss the days you want to take time off with your supervisor (Afian) and make sure that any outstanding work is either completed or handed over to a colleague. Once the leave is approved (in writing, through slack or whatsapp), please update the Movement Chart Trello board (https://trello.com/b/xRuJXqPw/movement-chart).

## Remote Work Policy

Afi Labs is a Remote First company - we give our employees the freedom to work anywhere. However, from time to time (e.g. for the Alliance 21 contract) I will ask you to come to Singapore to work onsite or attend meetings. This will allow you to better understand the needs of our clients and the challenges that we face as a company in attracting new business and maintaining existing clients. If you will not be working from Saigon (e.g. going back to home town for a few days) please notify your supervisor (Afian) via slack or whatsapp and update the Movement Chart Trello board (https://trello.com/b/xRuJXqPw/movement-chart). This is so that either Afian or Nelson does not visit Saigon while you are away (we come up to interact and work together with everyone on the team).
